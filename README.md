# <center> MIP (Moon Image Processor)

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/K-D-B/A-simplistic-image-processor-based-on-FPGA)   <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/powered by-ddl-brightgreen">  

## Overview

This is a simplistic image processor based on ```FPGA ``` with 3 periphery devices ( ```OV2640``` camera, ``` PS2``` keyboard and ```VGA```). By pressing specific buttons, not only can you add different filters to the video stream captured by the camera , but sharpen the image or detect the edges .
