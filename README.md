## Overview

This is a simplistic image processor based on ```FPGA ``` with 3 periphery devices ( ```OV2640``` camera, ``` PS2``` keyboard and ```VGA```). By pressing specific buttons, not only can you add different filters to the video stream captured by the camera , but sharpen the image or detect the edges .
